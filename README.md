## Table Tennis Bracket Generator

My submission for the DevelopMe coding bottcamp technical challenge.

This web app is designed to allow a user to create a list of players for their table tennis tournament and then generate a tournament bracket using those players.

The app also allows for scoring individual games and when a winner is decided, the bracket is updated to reflect those results.

The app supports a player count of any single-elimination legal number of players. (2, 4, 8, 16, 32...)

A live version of the app can be found here - http://aden.developme.space/
